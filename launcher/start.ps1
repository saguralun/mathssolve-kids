#    already booting (and stacking up extra windows).
# 1) Kills any previous MathsSolve dev-server window (marked, even if hidden)
#    plus anything already listening on the app port, so relaunches never stack.
# 2) Starts the dev server in a fully hidden PowerShell window.
# 3) Immediately opens Chrome "app mode" on launcher\loading.html — a splash
#    with a progress bar that shows while the server boots and forwards
#    itself to the practice screen the moment the server answers.
